## Visual Studio Code
VSCode is the most popular choice for a text editor for Golang, but you can use any text editor.
You can download VSCode from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you mind using closed source binaries you can always opt for [https://vscodium.com/](https://vscodium.com/) which is all open source.

After you install VSCode you need to add support for Go by installing the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) and also install all it's dependencies.
